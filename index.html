                    "I don't have much, monetary speaking...as an adult, I never have. I've had to work as hard as anyone to keep my head above water. I carried this as a burden for a long time. It seemed that as soon as I got ahead, I'd be pulled back in...only deeper. It was 'so unfair.'
                    <br><br>
                    I was so caught up in feeling sorry for myself that I was missing what was happening.... I wasn't burdened...I was BLESSED!!
                    <br><br>
                    There was always somebody there with an extended hand and a smile. I've never gone without for long. Be it food, utilities, transportation, clothes or just a 'you're going to be alright'...even a washer and dryer.... I've been helped by SO many.
                    <br><br>
                    I still need help, as we all do but I've decided it's time for me to Pay It Forward and I became a Mom On a Mission."
